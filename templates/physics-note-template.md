# Topic Name

Summary: A brief, high-level overview of the physical system, core concepts, and the objective of this note.

## Fundamental Principles
> [!abstract] Intuition
> Provide physical intuition here. What is the core idea?

- **Physical System**: Define the boundaries and components.
- **Assumptions**: List approximations (e.g., vacuum, rigid body, non-relativistic).

## Mathematical Formalism
### Governing Equations
State the primary equations (e.g., Euler-Lagrange, Schrödinger, Maxwell).
$$
\mathcal{L} = T - V
$$

### Derivation
1. **Step 1**: Start from first principles.
2. **Step 2**: Apply constraints.
3. **Step 3**: Solve for the final relation.

## Physical Consequences
- **Direct Results**: What does the math imply?
- **Symmetry & Conservation**: (e.g., Noether's Theorem applications).

## Specialized Applications (Optional)
- **Edge Cases**: High energy limits, low temperature behavior.
- **Experimental Verification**: Famous experiments (e.g., [[Michelson-Morley Experiment]]).
