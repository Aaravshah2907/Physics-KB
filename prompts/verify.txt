TASK:
Analyze the provided physics note for mathematical rigor and physical consistency.
1. Check for dimensional consistency in all formulas.
2. Verify that mathematical derivations logically follow from step to step.
3. Identify any physical "hallucinations" or common misconceptions that may have been introduced.
4. Check for LaTeX syntax errors.

OUTPUT FORMAT:
- If no errors are found, output ONLY: "✅ VERIFIED: No technical inconsistencies found."
- If errors are found, list them as:
  - [TYPE: Mathematical/Physical/Syntax]
  - [LOCATION: Heading Name]
  - [DESCRIPTION: Why it is wrong and what is the correct version]
