      "summary": "**Classical Mechanics** is the branch of physics describing the motion of macroscopic objects, from projectiles to parts of machinery, and astronomical objects, such as spacecraft, planets, stars, and galaxies. It is based on the foundational principles laid out by Isaac Newton and later reformulated in more abstract and powerful frameworks by Lagrange and Hamilton. At its core, it assumes a deterministic universe where the state of a system at any future time is fully determined by its current state and the forces acting upon it. While accurate for macroscopic scales and speeds much lower than the speed of light, it is superseded by **Quantum Mechanics** at atomic scales and **General Relativity** at high speeds or strong gravitational fields.",

While [[eulerlagrange-equations-for-unconstrained-systems]] provide a powerful method for generalized coordinates that are independent, many physical systems involve constraints that relate coordinates to one another (e.g., a pendulum bob fixed to a rod, a particle moving on a surface). We introduce the method of **Lagrange Multipliers** to incorporate these constraints into the variational principle, allowing us to solve for both the motion of the system and the forces of constraint.",
